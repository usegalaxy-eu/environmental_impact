## ELIXIR All Hands Meeting 2023

The ELIXIR AHM 2023 will be in **Dublin** and it's not that easy to reach Ireland by train :wink:.
An alternative to a flight is a ferry and with [Direct-Ferries](https://www.directferries.com) booking a boattrip to Dublin
is straight forward.
We recommend to travel from Cherbourg for all people nearby France and from Holyhead for our UK friends. Its also possible
to travel with the Eurostar express to the UK and then with the Ferry.

## Freiburg → Thessaloniki

* Freiburg → Brindisi booked with [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/) 141€
* Ferry from Brindisi → Igoumenitsa booked over https://www.directferries.de 100 € (two way)
* optional Hotel in Igoumenitsa
* Bus Igoumenitsa → Thessaloniki https://ktelbus.gr/thesp/ticketweb/ 37€

## ELIXIR All Hands Meeting 2024

Travelling to and from **Uppsala**. Also applicable to travelling to **Turku** for the **ECCB 2024!**

_Note:_ Night trains from Germany to Stockholm ([SJ](https://www.sj.se/en/search-journey/choose-journey/Hamburg%20Hbf/Stockholm%20Central/2024-06-07), [Snälltåget](https://www.snalltaget.se/en/berlin#)) get full quickly, and may not always run on Saturday night. Friday departure looks alright though, with both companies (if you can afford a weekend in Stockholm/Uppsala/..). However, to arrive to Uppsala on Sunday evening, we recommend a **day connection from Hamburg** (or an early-morning connection from other German cities). Night trains to Hamburg with beds and couchettes are run by [ÖBB NightJet](https://www.nightjet.com/en/ticket-buchen#/home). Alterantively, for staying in Hamburg overnight, [Generator](https://staygenerator.com/generator-properties/generator-hamburg?lang=en-GB) is right next to the station, a little bit run-down, but safe and cheap.
